PROJECT: Fix Preserve 
         [Fix ownership and permissions if you forgot to preserve]

- STICKY BITS
  LEVEL:		NOT CRITICAL
  STATUS:		FIXED
  DESCRIPTION:	Sticky bits on files are completely ignored.
  POSSIBLE FIX: Haven't given enough thought and research of possible
  				scenarios and fixes

- SYMBOLIC LINKS
  LEVEL: 		CRITICAL
  STATUS:		FIXED
  DESCRIPTION:	Symbolic links v/s a regular file with the same name may not
            	get handled as expected.
  POSSIBLE FIX: Ignore such mismatch and do not launch chmod.
