PROJECT: Fix Preserve 
         [Fix ownership and permissions if you forgot to preserve]
CONTENT: A bash script
AUTHOR:  Names in the accompanied AUTHORS.txt
LICENSE: The MIT License


QUICK SHORT DESCRIPTION:
fxpres is a bash script that copies ownership and permission of a 
set of files and applies the same to another set of files.
Contents of the files are not changed.

USAGE:
	 fxpres <src or model directory> <destination directory>

	eg:
	 fxpres /ubuntu10.10/usr/bin /usr/bin

	<Read below for further explanation>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
Ownership and permission of files in the model directory are 
copied to the files (with the same name) in the destination 
directory. 

NOTE: 
* File contents in the destination directory remain unchanged.
* Only the files with the same name in both 
  directories (source or model directory and destination directory) 
  are operated on, others are ignored.

WHAT DOES THIS EXAMPLE COMMAND DO ?

fxpres /ubuntu10.10/usr/bin /usr/bin

--------------------------------
say, BEFORE running the script, 
Following files exist in the model (or source) directory:
-rwxr-sr-x 1 root utmp 340604 2010-06-18 22:42 /ubuntu10.10/usr/bin/screen
-rwsr-xr-x 1 test test 10     2010-06-18 22:42 /ubuntu10.10/usr/bin/test

and, these files exist in the destination directory:
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 340604 2010-06-18 22:42 /usr/bin/screen
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 10     2010-06-18 22:42 /usr/bin/test
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 42752  2010-06-18 22:42 /usr/bin/at

Note the differences between 'screen' and 'test' files:
* Their owner and groups are different
* Their setuid and setgid permissions are different

---------------------------------

AFTER running the script:
Following files exist in the model (or source) directory:
-rwxr-sr-x 1 root utmp 340604 2010-06-18 22:42 /ubuntu10.10/usr/bin/screen
-rwsr-xr-x 1 test test 10     2010-06-18 22:42 /ubuntu10.10/usr/bin/test

and, these files exist in the destination directory:
-rwxr-sr-x 1 root utmp 340604 2010-06-18 22:42 /usr/bin/screen <= CHANGED: Ownership+Perm.
-rwsr-xr-x 1 test test 10     2010-06-18 22:42 /usr/bin/test   <= CHANGED: Ownership+Perm. 
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 42752  2010-06-18 22:42 /usr/bin/at     <= UNCHANGED/IGNORED

NOTE: File 'at' is ignored because it exists only in one of the directory.

-----------------------------------

HISTORY:
Every good story has a history - a rich background.

Need for writing this short script came about when I moved
my /usr partition to a larger partition upon facing a space
crunch. Although I preserved the links, I forgot to preserve
ownership and permission and had to write this short script.
That in part explains the name of this script/project.

IMPROVEMENTS:
Although the current incarnation of this script is sufficient
for my need, I'm sure there are neater ways to improve it's 
efficiency. You are most welcome to improve (or make attempts).
