PROJECT: Fix Preserve 
         [Fix ownership and permissions if you forgot to preserve]


WISHLIST:

1) Verbose mode
   Besides scripts own, enable the same of chmod/chown.

2) Dry mode
   Only shows what changes would be made, without actually 
   making those.

3) Ability to undo changes
   Perhaps store previous ownership/permissions
   before changing. Read and undo upon request.
